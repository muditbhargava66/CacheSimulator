You need to provide a trace file (e.g., `trace1.txt`) containing the memory access trace that the simulator will process.

The trace file should follow the format specified in the README:

```
r|w <hex_address>
```

- `r` for a read access, `w` for a write access
- `hex_address`: The memory address in hexadecimal format

Each line in the trace file represents a single memory access.

Here's an example trace file (`trace1.txt`):

```
r 0x1234
w 0x5678
r 0xabcd
r 0x1234
w 0x5678
r 0xabcd
r 0x1234
w 0x5678
r 0xabcd
```

To use this trace file with the simulator, save it in a file named `trace1.txt` (or any other desired name) and provide the path to the file as the last command-line argument when running the simulator:

```bash
./cachesim 64 1024 2 4096 4 0 0 /path/to/trace1.txt
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/trace1.txt` with the actual path to your trace file.

If you don't have a trace file ready, you can create one manually or generate it using a separate program that simulates memory accesses of a specific workload or benchmark.

Once you have a valid trace file, the simulator should be able to read and process the memory accesses from the file and provide the cache statistics as output.
