## Implementation Notes

Each feature should be implemented with the following in mind:

1. **Backward compatibility**: New features should not break existing functionality
2. **Configurability**: Features should be configurable via command-line or config files
3. **Testing**: Each feature should include comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: All features should be documented in the appropriate files
5. **Performance**: Implementations should consider performance implications
6. **Modern C++**: Use C++17 features appropriately
