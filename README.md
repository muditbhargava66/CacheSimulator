# CacheSimulator
A configurable cache and memory hierarchy simulator implemented in C++. It models the behavior of a two-level cache hierarchy with parameters like cache size, associativity, and block size. The simulator processes memory access traces, implements write-back and write-allocate policies, and reports cache access statistics.
